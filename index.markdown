Digital History offers a set of methodologies that share the use of computation to ask and answer 
research questions that would be difficult or impossible to ask and answer without the affordances
of computers. 

My work focuses on using the [Text Encoding Initiative](https://tei-c.org/){:target="_blank"} (TEI) 
standard of XML to encode linked open data resources for preserving the cultural heritage of 
the Syriac tradition(see [my CV](https://dlschwartz.github.io/cv/){:target="_blank"} for more detail).

Digital History methodologies are very broad and there are many resources available to 
train historians in their use. This website is my initial foray into offering some pedagogical 
materials for doing digital history. Above you can find links to resoruces for customizing the
TEI using One Document Does it All (ODD) and Schematron. 

Perhaps I'll add additional materials later. But for now, enjoy these!
